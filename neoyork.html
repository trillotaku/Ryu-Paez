	<div class="answer">
		<p>RyU//P@3z is from a dystopian future, in a city called Neo-York. In this future the air pollution has reached a point of irreversible damage to the planet, that in order to survive cybernetics are needed just to breath. The skyline is filled with smog from the pollution and factories that absorb ions from the smog and release it back to the air for energy. The streets are filled with litter and street merchant who barter for goods like the rest of the world. Every corner is filled with street thugs who are looking to steal any goods you might have. Itâ€™s a very rough place to live in but RyU//P@3z does his best to survive.</p>
