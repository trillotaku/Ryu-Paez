		<p>The Scenery of Neo-York</p> 
	</div>

	<div class="answer">
		<p>Neo-York noise pollution is just as polluted as the air of the earth, filthy and overwhelming. The streets are filled with the clanking of garbage that are made with every step. The air is filled with smog making it almost impossible to breath without a mask with a filtering system on it. if one was to walk in Neo-York some sort of protection is needed, and must also watch their pockets from petty thieves. It’s not a city for the light hearted, and will break you if you aren’t prepared.</p>
