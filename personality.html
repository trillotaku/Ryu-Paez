	<div class="answer">
		<p>RyU//P@3z is a wandering scavenger who scavenges every nook and cranny for scrap to sell. He tends to keep to himself and knows how to stay out of trouble in a crime filled city like Neo-York. Despite that RyU//P@3z has this great sense of justice inside that makes him always help any soul who wanders the city and canâ€™t protect themselves. He is known to be quite skilled and regular natives to the city all know to watch out for him. </p>
