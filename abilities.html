		<p>What can RyU//P@3z do?</p> 
	</div>			
	</header>
	<div class="answer">
		<p>Not only is RyU//P@3z a skilled scavenger, getting to hard to reach places but he is also a skilled swordsman. He protects himself with a laser saber that he built himself with parts he scavenged, but only drawing it when its deemed necessary be it to protect himself or to protect others. He also carries around a hook gun that he uses to reach to high end places that might have potential scrap and to reach his home base that is at an abandoned rooftop. His mask is a cybernetic enhancement that helps him breath the polluted air, it also acts as a translator for when he communicates with merchants when he sells his scrap.</p>
